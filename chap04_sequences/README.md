### Note
- For the sake of simplicity, these algorithms only support *int lists* <small>(at least for `typing`)</small>.

### About *recursive* algorithms
- Well, I do have a hard time on understanding these algorithms.
- But you can make use of these tools to help you:
    - The *Debug* feature <small>(if you're using [*VSCode*](https://code.visualstudio.com))</small>
    - [*Python tutor*](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) <small>(see the code visualized step by step)</small>
- Also my own notes here
    > When the *recursive* function was called <small>(I mean the 2nd time which it was <q>*recursively*</q> called)</small>, you **should** consider it as a **REAL** function, what I mean by this is that *all the subsequent code inside the function IS no longer the original params & states*.
    > Also, even though the <small>(recursively called)</small> function reaches to the end, that doesn't mean it is the *end*. Well, if I put this more formally, it would be called ***call stack***. That's a very important concept while learning *recursive* algorithms.
